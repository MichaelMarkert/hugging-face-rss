The mixture of diffusion processes is done in a way that harmonizes the generation process, preventing \"seam\" effects in the generated image. Using several diffusion processes in parallel has also practical advantages when generating very large images, as the GPU memory requirements are similar to that of generating an image of the size of a single tile. elismasilva/mixture-of-diffusers-sdxl-tiling See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/elismasilva/251775641926329", "date_published": "2025-02-12T17:18:22.157761"}]}
