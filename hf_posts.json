For each benchmark, I have compared RTX 5090 against RTX 3090 TI so we see the speed improvement. Moreover, I have tested FP8 vs 16-bit precision for FLUX and SD 3.5 Large and SD 3.5 Medium models. Furthermore, I have tested the speed impact of changing prompt on FLUX DEV model since one of the follower had requested. Full specs of the system provided below. I have used SwarmUI with ComfyUI backend so these benchmarks are literally done on ComfyUI you can think as. Currently no other interface / UI supporting RTX 5000 series as far as i know.

You can now see exactly how much energy your chosen model will consume, with a simple 5-star rating system. Think appliance energy labels, but for AI. Looking at transcription models on the leaderboard is fascinating: choosing between whisper-tiny or whisper-large-v3 can make a 7x difference. Real-time data on these tradeoffs changes everything. 166 models already evaluated across 10 different tasks, from text generation to image classification. The whole thing is public and you can submit your own models to test. Why this matters: - Teams can pick efficient models that still get the job done - Developers can optimize for energy use from day one - Organizations can finally predict their AI environmental impact If you're building with AI at any scale, definitely worth checking out. \ud83d\udc49 leaderboard: https://lnkd.in/esrSxetj \ud83d\udc49 blog post: https://lnkd.in/eFJvzHi8 Huge...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/fdaudens/212771868233348", "date_published": "2025-02-15T05:19:21.203311"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/CultriX/110138158069042", "image": "", "title": "Final upgrade to the Multi-Agent Task Completion Space:", "content_text": "Final upgrade to the Multi-Agent Task Completion Space: CultriX/MultiAgent-CodeTask .

A code reviewing agent to iteratively provide feedback to improve the code generated by the coding agent until the code meets the required criteria after which it is approved. 5. A testing agent that tests the approved code or provides information on how to test it. 6. A documentation agent that provides documentation and a help message for the approved and tested code.

I've plotted the progress of AI agents on GAIA test set, and it seems they're headed to catch up with the human baseline in early 2026. And that progress is still driven mostly by the improvement of base LLMs: progress would be even faster with fine-tuned agentic models.
