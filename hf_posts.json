Make it easier to find the right models and datasets for your specific needs. It's already powering a semantic search for datasets Space.

This was a real technical challenge: for instance, serializing tools to export them meant that you needed to get all the source code for a tool, verify that it was standalone (not relying on external variables), and gathering all the packages required to make it run.
