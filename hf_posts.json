Instead of relying on explicit G2P, larger speech models implicitly learn this task by eating many thousands of hours of audio data. They often use a 500M+ parameter LLM at the front to predict latent audio tokens over a learned codebook, then decode these tokens into audio. Kokoro instead relies on G2P preprocessing, is 82M parameters, and thus needs less audio to learn. Because of this, we can cherrypick high fidelity audio for training data, and deliver solid speech for those voices. In turn, this excellent audio quality & lack of background noise helps explain why Kokoro is very competitive in single-voice TTS Arenas.

But it's closed, as usual. \u23f1\ufe0f So with a team of cracked colleagues, we set ourselves a 24hours deadline to replicate and open-source Deep Research! \u23f1\ufe0f \u27a1\ufe0f We built open-Deep-Research, an entirely open agent that can: navigate the web autonomously, scroll and search through pages, download and manipulate files, run calculation on data... We aimed for the best performance: are the agent's answers really rigorous? On GAIA benchmark, Deep Research had 67% accuracy on the validation set. \u27a1\ufe0f open Deep Research is at 55% (powered by o1), it is: - the best pass@1 solution submitted - the best open solution \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa And it's only getting started !

We're thrilled to announce the launch of the Hugging Face Agents course on Learn! This interactive, certified course will guide you through building and deploying your own AI agents. Here's what you'll learn: - Understanding Agents: We'll break down the fundamentals of AI agents, showing you how they use LLMs to perceive their environment (observations), reason about it (thoughts), and take actions. Think of a smart assistant that can book appointments, answer emails, or even write code based on your instructions. - Building with Frameworks: You'll dive into popular agent frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex and smolagents. These tools provide the building blocks for creating complex agent behaviors. - Real-World Applications: See how agents are used in practice, from automating SQL queries to generating code and summarizing complex documents. - Certification: Earn a certification by completing the course modules, implementing...", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/burtenshaw/334573649974058", "date_published": "2025-02-07T12:33:25.577633"}]}
