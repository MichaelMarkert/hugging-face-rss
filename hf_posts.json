Moreover, compared FP8 vs FP16 and changing prompt impact as well Video Link : https://youtu.be/jHlGzaDLkto In this video I have intensively compared RTX 5090 speed on FLUX DEV, FLUX Fill, SD 3.5 Large, SD 3.5 Medium, Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) and Stable Diffusion 1.5 (SD 1.5) models. For each benchmark, I have compared RTX 5090 against RTX 3090 TI so we see the speed improvement. Moreover, I have tested FP8 vs 16-bit precision for FLUX and SD 3.5 Large and SD 3.5 Medium models. Furthermore, I have tested the speed impact of changing prompt on FLUX DEV model since one of the follower had requested. Full specs of the system provided below. I have used SwarmUI with ComfyUI backend so these benchmarks are literally done on ComfyUI you can think as. Currently no other interface / UI supporting RTX 5000 series as far as i know.

This was a real technical challenge: for instance, serializing tools to export them meant that you needed to get all the source code for a tool, verify that it was standalone (not relying on external variables), and gathering all the packages required to make it run.
