I'm collecting audio data to train another TTS model: + AVM data: ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode audio & text from source + Professional audio: Permissive (CC0, Apache, MIT, CC-BY) This audio should *impress* most native speakers, not just barely pass their audio Turing tests. Professional-caliber means S or A-tier, not your average bloke off the street. Traditional TTS may not make the cut. Absolutely no low-fi microphone recordings like Common Voice. The bar is much higher than last time, so there are no timelines yet and I expect it may take longer to collect such mythical data. Raising the bar means evicting quite a bit of old data, and voice/language availability may decrease. The theme is *quality* over quantity. I would rather have 1 hour of A/S-tier than 100 hours of mid data. I have nothing to offer but the north star of a future Apache 2.0 TTS model, so prefer data that you *already have* and costs you *nothing extra* to send.

Instead of relying on explicit G2P, larger speech models implicitly learn this task by eating many thousands of hours of audio data. They often use a 500M+ parameter LLM at the front to predict latent audio tokens over a learned codebook, then decode these tokens into audio. Kokoro instead relies on G2P preprocessing, is 82M parameters, and thus needs less audio to learn. Because of this, we can cherrypick high fidelity audio for training data, and deliver solid speech for those voices. In turn, this excellent audio quality & lack of background noise helps explain why Kokoro is very competitive in single-voice TTS Arenas.

But it's closed, as usual. \u23f1\ufe0f So with a team of cracked colleagues, we set ourselves a 24hours deadline to replicate and open-source Deep Research! \u23f1\ufe0f \u27a1\ufe0f We built open-Deep-Research, an entirely open agent that can: navigate the web autonomously, scroll and search through pages, download and manipulate files, run calculation on data... We aimed for the best performance: are the agent's answers really rigorous? On GAIA benchmark, Deep Research had 67% accuracy on the validation set. \u27a1\ufe0f open Deep Research is at 55% (powered by o1), it is: - the best pass@1 solution submitted - the best open solution \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa And it's only getting started !
