Key Features & Strengths Multi-Area Prompt Support Input distinct descriptions for the left, center, and right regions (e.g., \"dense forest\" for the left, \"calm lake\" for the center, and \"majestic mountains\" for the right). This allows the system to seamlessly blend multiple scenes into one stunning panoramic image. \ud83c\udf04 Automatic Korean-to-English Translation If your prompt contains Korean text, it will be automatically translated into English before image generation. (For example, \"\uc548\uac1c \ub080 \uc0b0\" becomes \"Misty mountain\") \ud83d\udd04 This feature ensures that you can effortlessly use both English and Korean prompts.

It ranks #3 overall on our text-to-video human preference benchmark, but in terms of style and coherence, it outperforms even OpenAI Sora. However, it struggles with alignment, making it less predictable for controlled outputs. We've released a new dataset with human evaluations of Runway Gen-3 Alpha: Rapidata's text-2-video human preferences dataset.

The mixture of diffusion processes is done in a way that harmonizes the generation process, preventing \"seam\" effects in the generated image. Using several diffusion processes in parallel has also practical advantages when generating very large images, as the GPU memory requirements are similar to that of generating an image of the size of a single tile. elismasilva/mixture-of-diffusers-sdxl-tiling See translation", "url": "https://huggingface.co/posts/elismasilva/251775641926329", "date_published": "2025-02-13T13:16:45.962978"}, {"id": "https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/116861695030454", "image": "", "title": "\"\ud835\udfee\ud835\udfec\ud835\udfee\ud835\udff1 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf9 \ud835\uddef\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\ude06\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddff \ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf3 \ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddc \ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude01\ud835\ude00\": this statement has often been made, here are numbers to support it.", "content_text": "\"\ud835\udfee\ud835\udfec\ud835\udfee\ud835\udff1 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf9 \ud835\uddef\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\ude06\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddff \ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf3 \ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddc \ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude01\ud835\ude00\": this statement has often been made, here are numbers to support it. I've plotted the progress of AI agents on GAIA test set, and it seems they're headed to catch up with the human baseline in early 2026. And that progress is still driven mostly by the improvement of base LLMs: progress would be even faster with fine-tuned agentic models.
