Key Features &amp; Strengths Multi-Area Prompt Support Input distinct descriptions for the left, center, and right regions (e.g., "dense forest" for the left, "calm lake" for the center, and "majestic mountains" for the right). This allows the system to seamlessly blend multiple scenes into one stunning panoramic image. 🌄 Automatic Korean-to-English Translation If your prompt contains Korean text, it will be automatically translated into English before image generation. (For example, "안개 낀 산" becomes "Misty mountain") 🔄 This feature ensures that you can effortlessly use both English and Korean prompts. Advanced Tiling Technology The project uses a sophisticated tiling approach that manages overlapping regions to produce natural transitions and high-...</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 05:19:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/fantos/903293233196599</guid></item><item><title>Time Stream ⏳🚀</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/ginipick/776720011919298</link><description>Time Stream ⏳🚀 Time Stream is a groundbreaking AI tool that transforms your text into a mesmerizing video journey from the past to the future.

It ranks #3 overall on our text-to-video human preference benchmark, but in terms of style and coherence, it outperforms even OpenAI Sora. However, it struggles with alignment, making it less predictable for controlled outputs. We've released a new dataset with human evaluations of Runway Gen-3 Alpha: Rapidata's text-2-video human preferences dataset. If you're working on video generation and want to see how your model compares to the biggest players, we can benchmark it for you. 🚀 DM us if you’re interested!

I've plotted the progress of AI agents on GAIA test set, and it seems they're headed to catch up with the human baseline in early 2026. And that progress is still driven mostly by the improvement of base LLMs: progress would be even faster with fine-tuned agentic models.

The mixture of diffusion processes is done in a way that harmonizes the generation process, preventing "seam" effects in the generated image. Using several diffusion processes in parallel has also practical advantages when generating very large images, as the GPU memory requirements are similar to that of generating an image of the size of a single tile. elismasilva/mixture-of-diffusers-sdxl-tiling See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 05:19:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/elismasilva/251775641926329</guid></item><item><title>Introducing OpenR1-Math-220k!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/lewtun/162100455547462</link><description>Introducing OpenR1-Math-220k! open-r1/OpenR1-Math-220k The community has been busy distilling DeepSeek-R1 from inference providers, but we decided to have a go at doing it ourselves from scratch 💪 What’s new compared to existing reasoning datasets? ♾ Based on AI-MO/NuminaMath-1.5 : we focus on math reasoning traces and generate answers for problems in NuminaMath 1.5, an improved version of the popular NuminaMath-CoT dataset. 🐳 800k R1 reasoning traces: We generate two answers for 400k problems using DeepSeek R1. The filtered dataset contains 220k problems with correct reasoning traces. 📀 512 H100s running locally: Instead of relying on an API, we leverage vLLM and SGLang to run generations locally on our science cluster, generating 180k reasoning traces per day. ⏳ Automated filtering: We apply Math Verify to only retain problems with at least one correct answer. We also leverage Llama3.3-70B-Instruct as a judge to retrieve more correct examples (e.g for cases with malformed answers...</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 05:19:51 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/lewtun/162100455547462</guid></item><item><title>📢 New Research Alert: Making Language Models Smaller &amp; Smarter!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/schuler/395413718646507</link><description>📢 New Research Alert: Making Language Models Smaller &amp; Smarter!
