Right now, I’m focusing on educational stuff and getting loads of new people to build open AI models using free and open source tools. I’ve made a collection of some of the tools I’m building and using for teaching. Stuff like quizzes, code challenges, and certificates. burtenshaw/tools-for-learning-ai-6797453caae193052d3638e2 See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 05:19:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/burtenshaw/555593095351748</guid></item><item><title>How do you make 1M+ Hugging Face models &amp; datasets more discoverable?</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/davanstrien/966932095656116</link><description>How do you make 1M+ Hugging Face models &amp; datasets more discoverable? davanstrien/Smol-Hub-tldr ! I fine-tuned HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-360M to generate one-line summaries from a model or dataset README. Its own self-description? "A model for generating concise summaries of model &amp; dataset cards from the Hugging Face Hub" The goal? Make it easier to find the right models and datasets for your specific needs. It's already powering a semantic search for datasets Space. It's still a WIP but thanks to @ loubnabnl , @ anton-l , @ eliebak et al, for cooking such a nice base model for fine-tuning small, efficient models for specific domains and tasks. 🙏 See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 05:19:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/davanstrien/966932095656116</guid></item><item><title>For those who haven't come across it yet, here's a handy trick to discuss an entire GitHub repo with an LLM:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/573811868569071</link><description>For those who haven't come across it yet, here's a handy trick to discuss an entire GitHub repo with an LLM: =&gt; Just replace "github" with "gitingest" in the url, and you get the whole repo as a single string that you can then paste in your LLMs See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 05:19:16 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/573811868569071</guid></item><item><title>hello, dev mode explorers!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/nroggendorff/464265972064174</link><description>hello, dev mode explorers!

It's nice to see researchers starting carrying out experiments to measure this! Gaudi3 results soon...

This was a real technical challenge: for instance, serializing tools to export them meant that you needed to get all the source code for a tool, verify that it was standalone (not relying on external variables), and gathering all the packages required to make it run.
