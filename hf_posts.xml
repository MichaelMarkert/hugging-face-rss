To keep up with current AI trends, new RAG types incorporate deep step-by-step reasoning, tree search, citations, multimodality and other effective techniques. Here's a list of 8 latest RAG advancements: 1. DeepRAG -&gt; DeepRAG: Thinking to Retrieval Step by Step for Large Language Models (2502.01142) Models retrieval-augmented reasoning as a Markov Decision Process, enabling strategic retrieval. It dynamically decides when to retrieve external knowledge and when rely on parametric reasoning. 2. RealRAG -&gt; RealRAG: Retrieval-augmented Realistic Image Generation via Self-reflective Contrastive Learning (2502.00848) Enhances novel object generation by retrieving real-world images and using self-reflective contrastive learning to fill knowledge gap, improve realism and reduce distortions. 3. Chain-of-Retrieval Augmented Generation (CoRAG) -&gt;...</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 05:08:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/Kseniase/113319295427497</guid></item><item><title>We did it.

I'm collecting audio data to train another TTS model:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/hexgrad/846477530846098</link><description>Wanted: Peak Data. I'm collecting audio data to train another TTS model: + AVM data: ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode audio &amp; text from source + Professional audio: Permissive (CC0, Apache, MIT, CC-BY) This audio should *impress* most native speakers, not just barely pass their audio Turing tests. Professional-caliber means S or A-tier, not your average bloke off the street. Traditional TTS may not make the cut. Absolutely no low-fi microphone recordings like Common Voice. The bar is much higher than last time, so there are no timelines yet and I expect it may take longer to collect such mythical data. Raising the bar means evicting quite a bit of old data, and voice/language availability may decrease. The theme is *quality* over quantity. I would rather have 1 hour of A/S-tier than 100 hours of mid data. I have nothing to offer but the north star of a future Apache 2.0 TTS model, so prefer data that you *already have* and costs you *nothing extra* to send. Additionally, *all* the new...</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 05:08:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/hexgrad/846477530846098</guid></item><item><title>VectorFlow ⚡: Transform Images into Professional Vector Graphics</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/664271513735189</link><description>VectorFlow ⚡: Transform Images into Professional Vector Graphics Convert your raster images (JPG, PNG, WEBP) into high-quality vector graphics (SVG, AI) with our easy-to-use tool!

Using Llama 3.1 8B as base, GRPO trainer from trl, and Unsloth optimizations, I got a working prototype in Bulgarian after ~5 hours on an L40S GPU. The approach should work for any language where the base model has some pre-training coverage. Full code and tutorial here: https://unfoldai.com/reasoning-in-a-non-english-language/ The model itself: s-emanuilov/LLMBG-Llama-3.1-8B-BG-Reasoning-v0.1 I hope this helps anyone looking to build reasoning models in their language.

Look, i'm not going to sit here and whine, complain and moan entirely - they know why i've left, they're going to thrive without me. I'm a mere spec compared to their future, and that's amazing. But the journey continues, i've posted my Design 101 for Ai - the first one up -- i BELEIVE it's the first one, as it delves back to how Arts and Crafts connect to AI. I'm still looking for a model hub in future for my insane 800+ models i'd published - considering that that's half of what i've got sitting in my repos on HF.

BT-SFT introduces: ✅ Smart tokenization method randomly masks tokens within &lt;think&gt; ... &lt;/think&gt; tags, promoting the model to generate diverse responses that align better with its probability distribution instead of memorizing the thought process from distilled data. ✅ Reward function that ensures responses are well-structured. Explore and contribute to the project available in my GitHub repository: https://github.com/mkurman/blurred-thoughts-SFT Keep me updated on your experiments with BT-SFT! 🐐 See translation</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 05:08:06 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/mkurman/739948560091317</guid></item></channel></rss>
