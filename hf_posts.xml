I'm collecting audio data to train another TTS model:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/hexgrad/846477530846098</link><description>Wanted: Peak Data. I'm collecting audio data to train another TTS model: + AVM data: ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode audio &amp; text from source + Professional audio: Permissive (CC0, Apache, MIT, CC-BY) This audio should *impress* most native speakers, not just barely pass their audio Turing tests. Professional-caliber means S or A-tier, not your average bloke off the street. Traditional TTS may not make the cut. Absolutely no low-fi microphone recordings like Common Voice. The bar is much higher than last time, so there are no timelines yet and I expect it may take longer to collect such mythical data. Raising the bar means evicting quite a bit of old data, and voice/language availability may decrease. The theme is *quality* over quantity. I would rather have 1 hour of A/S-tier than 100 hours of mid data. I have nothing to offer but the north star of a future Apache 2.0 TTS model, so prefer data that you *already have* and costs you *nothing extra* to send. Additionally, *all* the new...</description><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2025 19:00:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/hexgrad/846477530846098</guid></item><item><title>VectorFlow ⚡: Transform Images into Professional Vector Graphics</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/664271513735189</link><description>VectorFlow ⚡: Transform Images into Professional Vector Graphics Convert your raster images (JPG, PNG, WEBP) into high-quality vector graphics (SVG, AI) with our easy-to-use tool!

To keep up with current AI trends, new RAG types incorporate deep step-by-step reasoning, tree search, citations, multimodality and other effective techniques. Here's a list of 8 latest RAG advancements: 1. DeepRAG -&gt; DeepRAG: Thinking to Retrieval Step by Step for Large Language Models (2502.01142) Models retrieval-augmented reasoning as a Markov Decision Process, enabling strategic retrieval. It dynamically decides when to retrieve external knowledge and when rely on parametric reasoning. 2. RealRAG -&gt; RealRAG: Retrieval-augmented Realistic Image Generation via Self-reflective Contrastive Learning (2502.00848) Enhances novel object generation by retrieving real-world images and using self-reflective contrastive learning to fill knowledge gap, improve realism and reduce distortions. 3.
