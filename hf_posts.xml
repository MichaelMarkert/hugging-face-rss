Instead of relying on explicit G2P, larger speech models implicitly learn this task by eating many thousands of hours of audio data. They often use a 500M+ parameter LLM at the front to predict latent audio tokens over a learned codebook, then decode these tokens into audio. Kokoro instead relies on G2P preprocessing, is 82M parameters, and thus needs less audio to learn. Because of this, we can cherrypick high fidelity audio for training data, and deliver solid speech for those voices. In turn, this excellent audio quality &amp; lack of background noise helps explain why Kokoro is very competitive in single-voice TTS Arenas.

By leveraging linear temporal logic (LTL) to interpret natural language commands, SELP effectively handles complex commands and long-horizon tasks. 🤖 💡SELP presents three key insights: 1️⃣ Equivalence Voting: Ensures robust translations from natural language instructions into LTL specifications. 2️⃣ Constrained Decoding: Uses the generated LTL formula to guide the autoregressive inference of plans, ensuring the generated plans conform to the LTL. 3️⃣ Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning: Customizes LLMs for specific robotic tasks, boosting both safety and efficiency. 📊 Experiment: Our experiments demonstrate SELP’s...</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 17:01:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/lin-tan/763019179488759</guid></item><item><title>Introducing 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝗗𝗲𝗲𝗽-𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 by Hugging Face! 💥</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/410805194640777</link><description>Introducing 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝗗𝗲𝗲𝗽-𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 by Hugging Face! 💥 OpenAI's latest agentic app Deep Research seems really good... But it's closed, as usual. ⏱️ So with a team of cracked colleagues, we set ourselves a 24hours deadline to replicate and open-source Deep Research! ⏱️ ➡️ We built open-Deep-Research, an entirely open agent that can: navigate the web autonomously, scroll and search through pages, download and manipulate files, run calculation on data... We aimed for the best performance: are the agent's answers really rigorous? On GAIA benchmark, Deep Research had 67% accuracy on the validation set. ➡️ open Deep Research is at 55% (powered by o1), it is: - the best pass@1 solution submitted - the best open solution 💪💪 And it's only getting started ! Please jump in, drop PRs, and let's bring it to the top !

I'm glad that I was able to provide a little help together with @ its5Q to get this dataset published. This dataset contains: - Screenshots and recordings of mobile (iOS/Android) and web interfaces - UI navigation annotations and metadata - Screen categorization tags and text extractions - Navigation paths and screen relationships - Version control for UI imagery Perfect for training UI navigation agents and understanding interface patterns. The dataset provides detailed annotations linking screens, sections, and navigation flows together.

DOT is much smaller (sometimes 100 times less parameters) than previous SOTA models, trains faster, and avoids complexity: 🚫 No generative models (Diffusion, VAE, GANs) 🚫 No discretization/tokenization of actions 🚫 No reinforcement learning or multi-stage training ✅ Just learns from human demos, plain and simple This is still early — more complex real-life tasks need testing, and no guarantees it will actually work well there, but I think it's interesting to share. Sometimes, simpler approaches can be just as effective (or even better) than complex ones. 🔗 Open-source code and detailed description:...</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 17:01:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/IliaLarchenko/621814832633058</guid></item><item><title>🚨 Key takeaway of a quick mastering Sentiment Analysis nowadays.

Trough the questionare 📝 of the past RuOpinoinNE-2024 competition we got insights and participants model preference chocies. Our main conclusion: ✨ The submissions of the top performed models exploit Few-shot learning for LLM. Takeaway note comparing with the prior RuSentNE-2023 competition: 🧠 Reasoning in steps requires more actions for tweaking. Most recent solutions empowered with Chain-of-Thouhgt are tend to think too much. Earlier we might see improvements for the Flan-T5 (2.8B) in fine-tuned mode but not among the zero-shot approaches. nicolay-r/flan-t5-tsa-thor-xl Related materials: https://github.com/dialogue-evaluation/RuOpinionNE-2024 RuSentNE-2023: Evaluating Entity-Oriented Sentiment Analysis on Russian News Texts (2305.17679) Large Language Models in Targeted Sentiment Analysis (2404.12342) See translation</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 17:01:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/nicolay-r/887755882993305</guid></item><item><title>Hey everyone, we've given</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/victor/435864388294574</link><description>Hey everyone, we've given https://hf.co/spaces page a fresh update!
