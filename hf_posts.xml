Key Features &amp; Strengths Multi-Area Prompt Support Input distinct descriptions for the left, center, and right regions (e.g., "dense forest" for the left, "calm lake" for the center, and "majestic mountains" for the right). This allows the system to seamlessly blend multiple scenes into one stunning panoramic image. 🌄 Automatic Korean-to-English Translation If your prompt contains Korean text, it will be automatically translated into English before image generation. (For example, "안개 낀 산" becomes "Misty mountain") 🔄 This feature ensures that you can effortlessly use both English and Korean prompts. Advanced Tiling Technology The project uses a sophisticated tiling approach that manages overlapping regions to produce natural transitions and high-...</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 13:16:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/fantos/903293233196599</guid></item><item><title>Runway Gen-3 Alpha: The Style and Coherence Champion</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/jasoncorkill/476446672223675</link><description>Runway Gen-3 Alpha: The Style and Coherence Champion Runway's latest video generation model, Gen-3 Alpha, is something special. It ranks #3 overall on our text-to-video human preference benchmark, but in terms of style and coherence, it outperforms even OpenAI Sora. However, it struggles with alignment, making it less predictable for controlled outputs. We've released a new dataset with human evaluations of Runway Gen-3 Alpha: Rapidata's text-2-video human preferences dataset. If you're working on video generation and want to see how your model compares to the biggest players, we can benchmark it for you. 🚀 DM us if you’re interested!

The mixture of diffusion processes is done in a way that harmonizes the generation process, preventing "seam" effects in the generated image. Using several diffusion processes in parallel has also practical advantages when generating very large images, as the GPU memory requirements are similar to that of generating an image of the size of a single tile. elismasilva/mixture-of-diffusers-sdxl-tiling See translation</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 13:16:45 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/elismasilva/251775641926329</guid></item><item><title>"𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟱 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗯𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘆𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗼𝗳 𝗔𝗜 𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀": this statement has often been made, here are numbers to support it.</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/116861695030454</link><description>"𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟱 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗯𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘆𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗼𝗳 𝗔𝗜 𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀": this statement has often been made, here are numbers to support it. I've plotted the progress of AI agents on GAIA test set, and it seems they're headed to catch up with the human baseline in early 2026. And that progress is still driven mostly by the improvement of base LLMs: progress would be even faster with fine-tuned agentic models.

Physically Based Rendering, or PBR, materials play a huge role in realism. Join us the Friday to learn more. Duality.ai has been successful in using game engine simulation to create synthetic data that jumps the sim2 real gap for many commercial clients including JPL-NASA, AWS, P&amp;G, and more.

Our goal is to bring: 🚀 Faster uploads ⏬ Speedy downloads 💪 All without sacrificing your workflow To do that, we need the infrastructure and system and design to back it up. As we prepare to roll out the first Xet-backed repositories on the Hub, we wrote up a post explaining the nitty gritty details of the decisions that bring this to life https://huggingface.co/blog/from-chunks-to-blocks Complete with an interactive visualization that shows the power of deduplication in action - taking a 191GB repo to ~97GB and shaving a few hours off upload speeds. The darker each block in the heatmap, the more we dedupe, the less we have to transfer. Clicking on a file's blocks shows all other files that share blocks.
