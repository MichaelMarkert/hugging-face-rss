Key Features &amp; Strengths Multi-Area Prompt Support Input distinct descriptions for the left, center, and right regions (e.g., "dense forest" for the left, "calm lake" for the center, and "majestic mountains" for the right). This allows the system to seamlessly blend multiple scenes into one stunning panoramic image. üåÑ Automatic Korean-to-English Translation If your prompt contains Korean text, it will be automatically translated into English before image generation. (For example, "ÏïàÍ∞ú ÎÇÄ ÏÇ∞" becomes "Misty mountain") üîÑ This feature ensures that you can effortlessly use both English and Korean prompts.

To keep up with current AI trends, new RAG types incorporate deep step-by-step reasoning, tree search, citations, multimodality and other effective techniques. Here's a list of 8 latest RAG advancements: 1. DeepRAG -&gt; DeepRAG: Thinking to Retrieval Step by Step for Large Language Models (2502.01142) Models retrieval-augmented reasoning as a Markov Decision Process, enabling strategic retrieval. It dynamically decides when to retrieve external knowledge and when rely on parametric reasoning. 2. RealRAG -&gt; RealRAG: Retrieval-augmented Realistic Image Generation via Self-reflective Contrastive Learning (2502.00848) Enhances novel object generation by retrieving real-world images and using self-reflective contrastive learning to fill knowledge gap, improve realism and reduce distortions. 3.
