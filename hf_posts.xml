Kokoro TTS (v1.0) can now run 100% locally in your browser w/ WebGPU acceleration. Real-time text-to-speech without a server. ⚡️ Generate 10 seconds of speech in ~1 second for $0. What will you build? 🔥 webml-community/kokoro-webgpu The most difficult part was getting the model running in the first place, but the next steps are simple: ✂️ Implement sentence splitting, allowing for streamed responses 🌍 Multilingual support (only phonemization left) Who wants to help?

I'm collecting audio data to train another TTS model:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/hexgrad/846477530846098</link><description>Wanted: Peak Data. I'm collecting audio data to train another TTS model: + AVM data: ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode audio &amp; text from source + Professional audio: Permissive (CC0, Apache, MIT, CC-BY) This audio should *impress* most native speakers, not just barely pass their audio Turing tests. Professional-caliber means S or A-tier, not your average bloke off the street. Traditional TTS may not make the cut. Absolutely no low-fi microphone recordings like Common Voice. The bar is much higher than last time, so there are no timelines yet and I expect it may take longer to collect such mythical data. Raising the bar means evicting quite a bit of old data, and voice/language availability may decrease. The theme is *quality* over quantity. I would rather have 1 hour of A/S-tier than 100 hours of mid data. I have nothing to offer but the north star of a future Apache 2.0 TTS model, so prefer data that you *already have* and costs you *nothing extra* to send. Additionally, *all* the new...</description><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2025 05:07:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/hexgrad/846477530846098</guid></item><item><title>VectorFlow ⚡: Transform Images into Professional Vector Graphics</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/openfree/664271513735189</link><description>VectorFlow ⚡: Transform Images into Professional Vector Graphics Convert your raster images (JPG, PNG, WEBP) into high-quality vector graphics (SVG, AI) with our easy-to-use tool!

Because it facilitates teaching and learning! Over the past few months I've engaged with (no joke) thousands of students based on SmolLM. - People have inferred, fine-tuned, aligned, and evaluated this smol model. - People used they're own machines and they've used free tools like colab, kaggle, and spaces. - People tackled use cases in their job, for fun, in their own language, and with their friends. upvote the paper SmolLM2: When Smol Goes Big -- Data-Centric Training of a Small Language Model (2502.02737) See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2025 05:07:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/burtenshaw/638294801973727</guid></item><item><title>QwQ Edge Gets a Small Update..! 💬</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/964278651693422</link><description>QwQ Edge Gets a Small Update..! 💬 try now: prithivMLmods/QwQ-Edge 🚀Now, you can use the following commands for different tasks: 🖼️ @ image 'prompt...' → Generates an image 🔉@tts1 'prompt...' → Generates speech in a female voice 🔉 @ tts2 'prompt...' → Generates speech in a male voice 🅰️@text 'prompt...' → Enables textual conversation (If not specified, text-to-text generation is the default mode) 💬Multimodality Support : prithivMLmods/Qwen2-VL-OCR-2B-Instruct 💬For text generation, the FastThink-0.5B model ensures quick and efficient responses, prithivMLmods/FastThink-0.5B-Tiny 💬Image Generation: sdxl lightning model, SG161222/RealVisXL_V4.0_Lightning Github: https://github.com/PRITHIVSAKTHIUR/QwQ-Edge graph TD A[User Interface] --&gt; B[Chat Logic] B --&gt; C{Command Type } C --&gt;| Text | D [FastThink -0.5 B] C --&gt;| Image | E [Qwen2-VL-OCR -2 B] C --&gt;| @image | F [Stable Diffusion XL] C --&gt;| @tts | G [Edge TTS] D --&gt; H[Response] E --&gt; H F --&gt; H G --&gt; H See translation</description><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2025 05:07:07 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/prithivMLmods/964278651693422</guid></item><item><title>Colox is out, may be bugs!</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/retronic/535368526750340</link><description>Colox is out, may be bugs!
