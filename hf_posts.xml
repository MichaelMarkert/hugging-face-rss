Right now, I’m focusing on educational stuff and getting loads of new people to build open AI models using free and open source tools. I’ve made a collection of some of the tools I’m building and using for teaching. Stuff like quizzes, code challenges, and certificates. burtenshaw/tools-for-learning-ai-6797453caae193052d3638e2 See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 17:16:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/burtenshaw/555593095351748</guid></item><item><title>InspireMusic 🎵🔥 an open music generation framework by Alibaba FunAudio Lab</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/720327371561767</link><description>InspireMusic 🎵🔥 an open music generation framework by Alibaba FunAudio Lab Model: FunAudioLLM/InspireMusic-1.5B-Long Demo: FunAudioLLM/InspireMusic ✨ Music, songs, audio - ALL IN ONE ✨ High quality audio: 24kHz &amp; 48kHz sampling rates ✨ Long-Form Generation: enables extended audio creation ✨ Efficient Fine-Tuning: precision (BF16, FP16, FP32) with user-friendly scripts See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 17:16:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/AdinaY/720327371561767</guid></item><item><title>For those who haven't come across it yet, here's a handy trick to discuss an entire GitHub repo with an LLM:</title><link>https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/573811868569071</link><description>For those who haven't come across it yet, here's a handy trick to discuss an entire GitHub repo with an LLM: =&gt; Just replace "github" with "gitingest" in the url, and you get the whole repo as a single string that you can then paste in your LLMs See translation</description><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 17:16:48 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://huggingface.co/posts/m-ric/573811868569071</guid></item><item><title>RTX 5090 Tested Against FLUX DEV, SD 3.5 Large, SD 3.5 Medium, SDXL, SD 1.5 with AMD 9950X CPU and RTX 5090 compared against RTX 3090 TI in all benchmarks.

Moreover, compared FP8 vs FP16 and changing prompt impact as well Video Link : https://youtu.be/jHlGzaDLkto In this video I have intensively compared RTX 5090 speed on FLUX DEV, FLUX Fill, SD 3.5 Large, SD 3.5 Medium, Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) and Stable Diffusion 1.5 (SD 1.5) models. For each benchmark, I have compared RTX 5090 against RTX 3090 TI so we see the speed improvement. Moreover, I have tested FP8 vs 16-bit precision for FLUX and SD 3.5 Large and SD 3.5 Medium models. Furthermore, I have tested the speed impact of changing prompt on FLUX DEV model since one of the follower had requested. Full specs of the system provided below. I have used SwarmUI with ComfyUI backend so these benchmarks are literally done on ComfyUI you can think as. Currently no other interface / UI supporting RTX 5000 series as far as i know.

This was a real technical challenge: for instance, serializing tools to export them meant that you needed to get all the source code for a tool, verify that it was standalone (not relying on external variables), and gathering all the packages required to make it run.
